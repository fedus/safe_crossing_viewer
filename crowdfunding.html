    <h1>Questions & answers</h1>
    <h2>Why are we raising funds?</h2>
    <p>In October 2021, ZUG released the "Safe Crossing" project, in which we presented a crowd-sourced dataset of
      potentially unsafe pedestrian crossings on the territory of the City of Luxembourg, owing to the presence of
      parking spots too close to them.</p>
    <p>After the project got significant press coverage, the City of Luxembourg refuted the validity of ZUG's
      project and claimed that it has performed its own analysis of the situation. According to that in-house
      analysis, only 32 crosswalks were supposed to be problematic (the number later got revised to 37).</p>
    <p>ZUG then requested the City of Luxembourg release their own anaylsis by filing a request on the basis of the
      law of 14 september 2018. The City of Luxembourg denied the initial request citing dubious and shaky
      arguments, so ZUG escalated the matter to the "Commission d'accès aux documents" (CAD). In March 2022, The
      CAD ruled in ZUG's favour, stating that the City has to release the documents. However, the City again
      confirmed that it refuses to do so.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the law, ZUG has therefore decided to appeal this decision in a court of law. The appeal
      has been lodged at the end of June / beginning of July 2022.</p>
    <p>To help cover ZUG's legal fees related to the court proceedings, we are now running this crowdfunding and
      would be grateful for your generous support! Fees may be billed to us incrementally as the process evolves
      and depending on the hours billed by our lawyer. This means that we may launch multiple rounds of
      crowdfunding.</p>
    <p class="bold">Please note that you can find extensive information about the "Safe Crossing" project and the
      correspondence with the City of Luxembourg, as well as a complete and up to date press section on the
      project's website. <a href="https://zug.lu/safe-crossing/more.html">Click here</a> to visit it.</p>
    <h2>How exactly will my donation be used?</h2>
    <p>Your donation will be used first and foremost to cover our ongoing legal fees in relation to the court
      proceedings.</p>
    <p>We will keep this page updated to show the evolution of the crowdfunding and to inform donors about our legal
      bills.</p>
    <p>Should the case arise that all our legal fees are covered and that we have a surplus resulting from
      donations, these funds will be used to start additional legal proceedings (if applicable and useful), or to
      finance new projects.</p>
    <h2>Why should I donate? How does this concern me?</h2>
    <p>The City of Luxembourg's decision to refuse citizens access to information relating to their safety is
      problematic on multiple levels.</p>
    <p>For one, the administration is handling the situation in an opaque manner which goes against the spirit of a
      modern and transparent public body. The immediate result is a lack of accountability, since shortcomings
      resulting from the administrations decisions remain secret or unverifiable. None of the data ZUG has
      requested is sensitive in any way that could preclude the information from being made public.</p>
    <p>However, there is more. Apart from the issue about pedestrian safety as well, the City of Luxembourg's
      argumentation on which it bases its refusal to provide the documents is riddled with misinterpretations of
      applicable legislation and is partly purposely deceiptful.</p>
    <p>Some of the invoked points are "blanket arguments" that are routinely employed by the administration to
      detract annoying requests for information from the citizens, even though these arguments are completely
      unfounded or outright wrong. This shows a deep disregard for a healthy public discourse and a democratic
      process. Not just ZUG is affected by this abusive handling of requests for information, but every citizen
      and every association that will file similar requests in the future.</p>
    <p>In summary, you should donate to our cause if you care about at least one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>transparency in the matter of the "Safe Crossing" project and the release of the requested documents in
        relation to the safety of citizens</li>
      <li>better accountability of public administrations when it comes to freedom of information requests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We hope that the court proceedings will set a valuable precedent for future information requests that will
      make it harder for administrations to shy away from their responsibilities.</p>
