      <h3>At a glance</h3>
      <p>
        Safe Crossing is a project based on a crowd-sourced effort to assess if the setup of pedestrian crossings
        in Luxembourg-City complies with the <i>Code de la Route</i> (also: Highway Code). Specifically, users were asked to analyse whether or
        not there were parking spots within 5 metres of a pedestrian crossing, which is prohibited according to the
        <i>Code de la Route</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Results:</p>
      <ul class="result-highlight">
        <li>A total of 1787 pedestrian crossings were analysed.</li>
        <li>The setup of 475 (27%) crossings is likely in violation of the <i>Code de la Route</i></li>
        <li>For 162 (9%) crossings, no assessment was possible</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The remaining 1150 (64%) pedestrian crossings have been assessed as being in compliance with the
        <i>Code de la Route</i>.</p>
      <p class="result-highlight">This means that roughly a third of all pedestrian crossings in the City of Luxembourg
        may not be setup according to the rules of the law, despite the fact that such flaws have already been
        brought to attention of city leaders by an audit on pedestrian security in 2015.

    <h2>What is the project about?</h2>
    <p>
      Safe Crossing is a project that aims to highlight and assemble a list of pedestrian crossings within Luxembourg-City that
      appear to be in violation of Articles 164(2.)(e) & 166(h) of the <i>Code de la Route</i>:
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <h5>Art 164(2.) (excerpt)</h5>
      <p>L'arrêt des véhicules ou animaux est interdit:</p>
      <p>(e) sur les passages pour piétons, les passages pour piétons et cyclistes, les gués pour piétons et les gués pour cyclistes
        ainsi qu'à moins de 5 mètres de part et d'autre de ces passages ou gués, sauf signalisation dérogatoire temporaire ou
        sauf autorisation de l'autorité délivrée à titre temporaire</p>
      <h5>Art 166(h) (excerpt)</h5>
      <p>Le stationnement des véhicules ou animaux est interdit:</p>
      <p>(h) sur les passages pour piétons, les passages pour piétons et cyclistes, les gués pour piétons et les gués pour cyclistes
        ainsi qu'à moins de 5 mètres de part et d’autre de ces passages ou gués</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the MDDI recommends that this prohibition is materialized by appropriate
      road markings in order to increase the field of vision of road users and to optimize the safety of pedestrians.

    <h2>How was the data collected?</h2>
    <p>
      Safe Crossing is a crowd-sourced project. As such, the data has been generated in 2021 (from June to August) through a collective effort
      involving around 20 active volunteers. Volunteers have been approached on social media to ask whether they would be interested in
      participating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interested users were invited to install a custom-made application on their phone. Upon launch, the application presented users
      with a pedestrian crossing in Luxembourg-City on a map using satellite imagery. The volunteer was then asked to assess whether there
      were parking spots within 5 metres of the pedestrian crossing in question. The volunteers were able to measure the distance
      using a dedicated feature of the app that allowed them to draw a circle with a 5 metre radius and move it around the screen freely. This way,
      the distances around the pedestrian crossing could be measured with adequate accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Volunteers could then click one of three buttons: one button to state that there were no parkings within 5 metres of the pedestrian crossing
      (which would be in compliance with the law), another button to say that there were parking spots within 5 metres of the pedestrian crossing
      (which would be in violation of the law), and a last button to indicate that they were not sure of that it was impossible to tell (for instance
      because trees impeded visibility of the pedestrian crossing on the satellite image).
    </p>
    <p>
      After making a choice, the volunteer was presented with a new pedestrian crossing, and so forth.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>At what point did data collection stop?</h2>
    <p>
      Data collection stopped when all crossings in the database had at least 5 votes each. A threshold of 5 votes as a minimum per crossing
      was subjectively chosen to ensure that a somewhat robust conclusion can be drawn about the pedestrian crossing's setup's
      compliance with the <i>Code de la Route</i>.
    </p>
    <h2>How was the collected data processed?</h2>
    <p>
      Once data collection had finished, it was minimally processed. The only processing that took place was concerning crossings for
      which there was a tie after voting (that is, there was a tie between the possible outcomes that the crossing was in compliance with
      the law or not, or that it was impossible to say for volunteers). For these crossings, a manual intervention took place and a decision
      was made by a single volunteer to overturn the tie and assign a definitive status of being in compliant with the, or not being
      compliant with the law, or deciding that it was not possible to judge based on the satellite imagery.
    </p>
    <h2>Interpretation of the results</h2>
    <p>
      While no quality assurances can be made about the data as it has been crowd-sourced (and as it is subject to human error and
      factors like the quality of the data on OpenStreetMap as wel as the satellite imagery of Geoportail), the results are highly
      indicative of a general lack of safety for vulnerable road users in Luxembourg-City and in specific pedestrians.
      Roughly a quarter of all pedestrian crossings in the database were marked as having parking
      spots in a too close vicinity. This means that at all those crossings, there exists unnecessary danger for pedestrians as visibility
      is impeded and moving safely might be difficult due to the vicinity of parking spots.
    </p>
    <h2>What's the motivation for this project?</h2>
    <p>
      Luxembourg-City is a beautiful, vibrant city. However, it is also a city with a lot of individual, motorised traffic and
      therefore suffers from a lot of the disadvantages that come with the latter: congestion, noise, pollution - and also
      a high risk for pedestrians and cyclists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every human being that is hurt on our streets is one too many - and city leaders should do everything in their power
      to protect people as they walk or cycle. However, it turns out that when it comes to one of the most basic infrastructures
      for soft mobility, pedestrian crossings, there has been a lot of "creativity" to squeeze in more parking spots at the expense
      of pedestrian safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most often, this creativity manifests itself as starting the curb-side parking spots already well before the 5 metre
      minimum distance from the pedestrian crossing, but only letting the designated lay-by reach the full width exactly at
      the 5 metre mark. This is technically allowed by the <i>Code de la Route</i>, but on many pedestrian crossings this
      flexibility is stretched to the absolute maximum.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a great number of pedestrian crossings, there is simply no minimum distance left at all.
      On other occasions, and most often in 30km/h zones, there are no markings on the ground - neither for pedestrians, nor for cars. But
      in practice this means that drivers will take up every square inch for parking, disregarding that they impede visibility for pedestrians
      and cyclists but also other drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate the importance of visibility at pedestrian crossings, the following animation taken from Twitter is
      very powerful:

    <p>
      Jumping back to Luxembourg-City, take a look at the following example: the street on the top has adequate field of vision
      of the pedestrian crossing, while on the bottom one, parking spaces are put right next to it. Approaching drivers are unable
      to see pedestrians trying to engage on the street. As a consequence, they are exposed to unnecessary danger.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Therefore, this project aimed to highlight the extent of the problem, but also to show where the problematic crossings are.
      The ambition was one of positive citizen-powered action to help make the City of Luxembourg a safer place. City leaders
      are welcome and in fact encouraged to draw on the collected data to improve dangerous pedestrian crossings an align their setup
      with the <i>Code de la Route</i>.
